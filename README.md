# CochDNN
Model code for loading CochDNN auditory models (auditory models with cochleagram front end). 

Contains the in-house models used in the paper:
Greta Tuckute*, Jenelle Feather*, Dana Boebinger, Josh H. McDermott (2023): _Many but not all deep neural network audio models capture brain responses and exhibit correspondence between model stages and brain regions_.

(models upcoming. stay tuned!)
